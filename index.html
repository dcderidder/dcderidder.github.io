Hello world

What do you think about this?

I it cost me sometime to push this online but now it works!! 

The numbers work and are always right ? 

You want a nice riddle, if you can solve it an price wait for you at the end of the road.

So there are 3 farmers and they have an bird, they are thinking of selling the bird cause it makes too much noise. 

a woman comes a long and wants the bird, soy the settle on an price, 30 bucks but they feel a bit bad so give 5 buck back to the youngest to give back, however he only gives her 2 back and keeps one 
and give each other brother 1 one as well, so in total they keep 9 bucks and the women gets 2 back. 

but 3*9= 27 + the 2 bucks she got, where is the 1 buck?

Good luck
